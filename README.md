# SORTING
PLC (Ladder Logic) based sorting system project that uses a diffuse sensors and a pusher to automate the system using TIA portal V15, Factory I/O. The system consists of a conveyor belt to carry all the products, a diffuse sensors and a pusher, the system now utilizes the pushers to push the products in their collection conveyor belt. The diffuse sensor is used to identify any product passing in front of it on the conveyor belt. As soon as any product crosses the diffuse sensor, a specific signal is to be passed to the PLC which in turn operates the pusher to push out products in their collection conveyor belt. So this way we have developed the fully automated sorting system.
